MinGW compiler as tested doesn't include the thread class. So, if tried to compile the codes with multi-threading you may get "not declared" errors. 

Workaround
----------
I have included the Standard threads implementations that I have found on https://github.com/meganz/mingw-std-threads.
To run using these header files, you need to include them in the folder of your code and include the respective header file like this:
    #include "mingw.thread.h" 
instead of 
    #include <thread>
You also need to include the following line in your coding file as preprocessor:
    #define _WIN32_WINNT 0x0501
